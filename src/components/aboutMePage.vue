        Going back to school full-time leaves significantly less free time to pursue hobbies. However, whenever I come across some, it's usually divided between the following activities.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h4>Video games:</h4>
          <p><img src="@/assets/video_games.jpg" height="45%" width="45%"/> I became reacquainted with video games during the pandemic. Having enjoyed video games while growing up, my interest in the industry has also been rekindled by the advances made in technology. I find playing video games an effective and fun way to switch mental gears and escape, while at times still exercising problem solving faculties.  
            Aside from playing, among topics I follow, I am interested in the directions that independent game developers are taking and the ongoing evolution of triple-A games staying relevant in a competitive industry and how these companies deal with public relations with their consumers and fans.

           <h4>Cooking:</h4> 
           <p> <img class="right" src="@/assets/cooking.jpg" height="45%" width="45%"/>Cooking is a long-time skill and pastime that I am constantly trying to improve. Being able to cook is being able to take care of others. When I find the time to cook, I’m usually either trying new recipes or perfecting go-to favourites.
